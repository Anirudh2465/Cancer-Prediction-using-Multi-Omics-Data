# Cancer-Prediction-using-Multi-Omics-Data
Deep learning project using genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to predict cancer presence. Utilizes dimensionality reduction and attention mechanisms in a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to analyze and detect patterns for cancer prediction, offering insights into genomic variations and protein expressions.
