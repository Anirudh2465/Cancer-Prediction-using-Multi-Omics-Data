🧬 Multi-Omics Cancer Prediction Using Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
Predict cancer presence by harnessing the power of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data through cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to enhance cancer detection by integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model. By extracting patterns from complex biological data, we seek to provide an efficient and accurate prediction of cancer likelihood, offering insights into pathways, gene variations, and protein expressions.

🔍 Why This Project?
Traditional diagnostic tools often analyze single omics layers, which can miss critical cross-data patterns. By utilizing multiple omics, this model captures intricate relationships between genes, transcripts, and proteins, resulting in a more comprehensive analysis that boosts detection accuracy.
